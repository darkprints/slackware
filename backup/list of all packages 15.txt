system-config-printer: The purpose of the tool is to configure a CUPS server (often the local
system-config-printer: machine) using the CUPS API. The tool is written in Python, using
system-config-printer: pygtk for the graphical parts and Python bindings (pycups) for the
system-config-printer: CUPS API. It is largely the same as using the CUPS web interface for
system-config-printer: configuring printers, but has the advantage of being a native
system-config-printer: application rather than a web page.

xorg-server-xwayland: modified to use Wayland input devices for input and forward either the
xorg-server-xwayland: root window or individual top-level windows as wayland surfaces. The

xorg-server-xwayland: as it does when it runs natively. The main difference is that Wayland
xorg-server-xwayland: handles presentation of the windows instead of KMS.
