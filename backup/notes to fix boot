What I did, was to put a USB Slackware to boot, reach the root menu and type:

Code:

# mount -t ext4 /dev/sdaX /mnt
# mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
# mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
# mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
# chroot /mnt
# cd /etc
# nano lilo.conf

I got a regular lilo example from internet and wrote it
in the mismatching fields. Then:

Code:

# lilo
# exit
# umount /mnt/sys
# umount /mnt/proc
# umount /mnt/dev
# umount /mnt
# reboot
